## 1. Cartified!

Your task is to implement a basic shopping cart for a website, following these basic rules:

* the cart needs to be implemented as an AngularJS service
* the cart should be retrieved from the localStorage, where it's stored under the key `cart`
* every time an action is performed on the cart, it should be persisted on the localStorage
* the cart should only know about item IDs and their quantity
* you will write the cart by implementing the methods of the provided cart service in the code block below: please fork it and submit your implementation
* This is implemented with angular 1. You should use Angular or ReactJS.

``` javascript
angular.module('services.cart', [])
    .service('Cart', ['$rootScope', 'Reviewer', function ($rootScope, Reviewer) { 
        var getCart = function(){}
 
        var addItem = function(){};
 
        var addItems = function() {};
 
        var save = function() {};
 
        var remove = function () {};
 
        var clear = function() {};
 
        var persist = function() {};
 
        var changeQuantity = function (){};
 
        var refresh = function() {};
    }]);
```

### Methods explanation

For some of the methods mentioned in the empty Cart service, we thought of giving you some explanation to better understand what they're there for.

#### Save

Checks if the cart can be persisted through the `Reviewer` service: if so, it `persist`s it.

#### Clear

Empties the cart

#### Persist

Persist the cart on the localStorage

#### changeQuantity

Changes the quantity of one of the items in the cart.

#### Refresh

Notifies the application that the cart has been persisted, so that other parts of the app can modify themselves based on the latest cart update.

### Dependencies

You are not allowed to inject any dependency on the Cart service other than the ones provided:

* `$rootScope`: it is used for triggering events.
* `Reviewer`: it's an angular service that will review the contents of the cart (`Reviewer.review(cart)`, returns a promise)

### What are we going to look for?

* the fewer lines of code, the better
* clear, coincise, DRY implementation
* appropriate naming conventions

Another thing to consider: the cart should be working even when the user has multiple browser tabs open and is adding products from each of them.

We are **not** going to check the submitted script for syntax errors: concentrate on the design of the `Cart` service, we don't need to check for the small things

Please use **a simple one-file gist** (private or public) to submit your coding challenge.

## 2. BEAUTIFY

# Hacker Goods

Have you ever heard of hackernews? If you did, you know that it looks **quite bad**:

![HN](http://d1avok0lzls2w.cloudfront.net/img_uploads/SEOmoz-Hackernews-Rank.png)

What we request is to write make hackernews beautiful. **Really** beautiful.

You can fetch the HN data from the [unofficial API](http://api.ihackernews.com/page) and
use SASS, LESS, Stylus or custom CSS, Please no CSS framework. Your code must be clean, consistent and crystal clear.

You should use vanillaJS(Pure JavaScript) and no library/Framework. Add JS animations to make it spicy enough and then send us:

* 1 `index.html`
* 1 JS file
* 1 stylesheet (if you use a preprocessor, sends us the preprocessed one)

So that we can have a look at it!
